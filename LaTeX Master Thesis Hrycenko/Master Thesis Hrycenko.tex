\section*{Introduction}\

The collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s marked a significant turning point in global political and economic history. 
The complexity of carrying out political, territorial, and economic reforms simultaneously is often termed 
the "dilemma of synchronicity" \citep{A_Ramet2010}. A cornerstone of this economic paradigm 
shift was privatization, which entailed the replacement of planned economies with free-market principles.
That process was expected to lead to increased efficiency, economic growth, and improved living standards. 
However, the outcomes of this transition have been far from uniform across countries, with some nations experiencing 
significant improvements in health and mortality rates, while others have faced deteriorating conditions \citep{B_Brainerd1998}.

This paper draws on ...

% "enforced reform" (Czech Republic, Croatia), and "reform without negotiation" or 
% "imposed transformation" (Bulgaria, Serbia), a category that often includes Russian Federation 
% and other former Soviet states, which also experienced systemic "implosion" \citep{BujwidKurek_Transformacja2015}. 

\section*{Relevant Literature}\
\subsection*{Transition Types}\

The widespread institutional collapse across Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union in the late 1980s 
led to an imperative for simultaneous political, territorial, and economic restructuring. 
Within the academic field of transitology, literature seeks to define and categorize these complex processes in various ways \citep{C_BujwidKurek_Transformacja2015}. 
Probably the most commonly referenced typology of transformation processes \citep{C_BujwidKurek_Transformacja2015} of Samuel Huntington divides countries into three categories based on the nature of their reforms \citep{D_Huntington1991}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item "transformation" (e.g., Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary) - when reformators group is originated in government elites, 
    \item "transplacement" (e.g., Czechoslovakia, Poland) - when the reforms are imposed by both government elites and opposition forces, as it happened during the round table talks,
    \item "replacement" (e.g., East Germany, Romania) - when oposition has a significant role in reforms.
\end{itemize}
These categories reflect the degree of domestic consensus and external pressure influencing the reform processes. 
It is also worth mentioning that both power camp and oposition are divided, government into reformators and "hard-headed", oposition into moderates and radicals.
In case of other classifications, they mostly match the above-mentioned typology, sometimes however some differences in countries grouping can be observed.
Sometimes, a separate category is being created for countries created from multi-national states, like Czechoslovakia or Yugoslavia, due to merged effect 
of divisions on the level of top leadership and the nationalistic pressure from below. \citep{Wiatr2020}.
Worth to mention is also the division proposed by Herbert Kitschelt due to underlining group of countries where preemptive reforms were the idea. Examples are Soviet Union Gorbachev’s initial 
innovations, as well as the regime changes in Bulgaria, Romania etc. \citep{Kitschelt2001}.


% The foundational political literature provides various typologies for these regime changes, 
% classifying states based on the role of the former communist elite and the opposition, thus establishing the initial political trajectory:
% • Negotiated System Reform: Characterized by pacts and agreements between the opposition and reformist elements of the communist party, exemplified by Poland and Hungary.
% • Enforced Reform: Occurring when the old regime was weak and opposition was strong, as seen in the Czech Republic and Croatia.
% • Reform without Negotiation / Imposed Transformation: Where reforms were controlled from above by existing elites, often resulting in systemic "implosion," a category frequently applied to Bulgaria, Serbia, Russian Federation, and other FSU states.



% The long-term success of these transitions is assessed by the quality of the new political institutions. 
% Research in this area uses the institutional definition of the political system (encompassing state apparatus, parties, and legal framework) to analyze development. 
% A key finding in the literature is that initial political reforms frequently led to "facades of democratic institutions". 
% In these defective regimes, formal legal norms (often copied from consolidated Western democracies) lacked the "moral and cultural infrastructure" for effective functioning. 
% This weakness allowed political elite dominance over codified law and provided fertile ground for corruption, particularly in states where the political process was far from accountable and transparent. 
% The success of political reform was often predicted by the outcome of the first competitive election; clear opposition victories facilitated the "bundling" of liberalization and democratic consolidation, 
% as seen in Poland and the Czech Republic

%they are often also contrasting the short-term "transition" with the long-term, multi-dimensional "transformation" 
%required for institutionalization. The complexity has led some scholars to categorize the changes as a "refolution", combining peaceful reform with revolutionary scope.




%Transition process. Once the structural economic crisis of communist
%  regimes set in, the repressiveness of communist rulers and the (virtual)
%  resourcefulness of the opposition shaped the transitions to democracy
%  in the late 1980s. Under bureaucratic-authoritarian communism the
%  ruling parties were intransigent to reform and clung on to power until
%  the bitter end, but an urban middle-class opposition was potentially
%  resourceful against the backdrop of historical memories and practical
%  experiences in the interwar period. Communism here disappeared at a
%  late stage by implosion when the ruling parties could no longer contain
%  demands for fundamental change. The collapse of East Germany and of
%  the Czechoslovak regime in November 1989 exemplify this case.
%  Under national-accommodative communism, where the incumbent
%  party was more flexible in granting reforms and limited civil rights and
%  thus allowed opposition groups to become comparatively resourceful,
%  democracy evolved through a negotiated transition between rulers and
%  representatives of the opposition. Prolonged bargaining characterized
%  the transitions in Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, and possibly in Croatia
%  and the Baltic countries, where the communist party leaderships began
%  to accept oppositional representation before the communist regimes
%  collapsed.
%  Under patrimonial communism, by contrast, rulers had relied on
%  repression and cooptation and opposition forces remained weak and
%  isolated, thus never creating a serious threat to the political incumbents.
%  When communism was crumbling in one country after the other, elements
%  of the ruling communist parties themselves chose preemptive reform to
%  salvage as much of their power as possible into a new postcommunist
%  era in which they expected to continue their domination over a passive
%  civil society. Preemptive reform was the idea behind Gorbachev’s initial
%  innovations, as well as the regime changes in Bulgaria, Romania, some
%  of the Yugoslav republics, and many of the Soviet republics in 1990-91 \citep{Kitschelt2001}.


\subsection*{Economic Transformation and the Privatization Debate}\
Privatization was universally deemed a central component of the economic transformation, necessary to replace the inefficient command economy with market principles \citep{Estrin1994} \citep{Berg1992}.
The public debate was dominated by a dichotomy regarding the pace and method of implementation betwen two camps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Neoliberal advisors - who championed "shock therapy", advocating for the rapid and simultaneous implementation of price and trade liberalization, stabilization, 
    and mass privatization \citep{Hamm2012}. This approach was intended to create an irreversible shift to the market.
    \item Critics - often described as gradualist economists or neo-institutionalists, argued that hasty reform damaged the state and favored a slower process to allow 
    sufficient time for essential governing institutions (e.g., corporate law, capital markets) to develop \citep{Stuckler2009} \citep{Rohac2016}.
\end{itemize}

Talking about the specific privatisation methods chosen across the Central and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, they yielded varied results and attracted distinct academic critiques:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mass (Voucher) Privatization: While the econometric results suggest that mass privatization, overall, had a significant positive effect on growth after the initial 
    recession (after 1995) \citep{Estrin2004}, its implementation, particularly in the Czech Republic, was criticized for leading to "budgetary crises and unleashing inflation at the macroeconomic level" \citep{Marcincin1997}.
    \item Insider Privatization: Models that favored management and employees (e.g., Russian Federation and Ukraine) led to "insider dominance" and were generally less 
    effective at restructuring than market methods \citep{Estrin2004} \citep{Djankov2002}. This approach was associated with political continuity and was mostly retricted especially in the Czech Republic and Hungary, but also to a lesser extent
    in Poland, where hard political transition had weakened the political positions of former communist managers \citep{Soos1997}.
    \item Corruption and Fiscal Shock: The literature confirms that the transition created new incentives for corruption due to the massive transfer of property, 
    coupled with weak states and underdeveloped civil societies \citep{Kaufmann1997} \citep{Hoff2004} \citep{Stiglitz1999}. Research shows that privatization's general growth effect hinges on the quality of the institutional setting, 
    often proxied by the level of corruption \citep{Cieslik2018}. Furthermore, the implementation of mass privatization programs is empirically demonstrated to have created a massive fiscal 
    shock for post-communist governments, which undermined state capacity and protection of property rights, thereby exacerbating the recession \citep{Hamm2012}.
\end{itemize}

The general dissatisfaction with the privatization process stemmed from the realisation of the process and its outcomes, rather than opposition to private property itself \citep{Denisova2012}. 
The popular demand for revising privatization was strongly correlated with individuals who experienced hardships during the transition, such as wage cuts, 
unemployment, or poor self-rated health.

\subsection*{Mortality and Health Outcomes}\
The political and economic upheaval led to a severe post-socialist mortality crisis between 1989 and 1995, 
resulting in an estimated 10 million excess deaths between 1990 and 2000 \citep{Cornia2014}. However, different countries experienced 
divergent trajectories in health outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Severe Crisis: FSU states, including Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Belarus, experienced dramatic and prolonged mortality reversals \citep{Eberstadt1999}. 
    Russian Federationn male life expectancy, for example, dropped by 6.6 years between 1989 and 1994, reaching a level three years below that of India, 
    which was then a poor agrarian economy \citep{Cornia2016}.  
    The death toll in post-Soviet states reached an estimated 7 million premature deaths, with 4 million in Russian Federation alone \citep{Azarova2018}.
    \item Rapid Recovery: Central European countries, such as the Czech Republic and Poland, were the first former Communist countries to see a 
    "rapid and sustained increase in life expectancy" after 1991 \citep{Fihel2011}.
\end{itemize}

To understand what drove these demographic shifts, it is necessary to analyze the direct causes of death.
Accorging to literature, the immediate cause during the crisis was primarily "violent mortality" including ischemic cardiovascular diseases, circulatory problems, 
external causes (accidents, suicide), and alcohol poisoning, particularly among working-age men \citep{Cornia2014} \citep{Azarova2018}.

This surge was especially pronounced among 20–39 year olds, who were affected mostly by external causes of death, and 40–59 year olds, 
who were mainly hit by a rise in cardiovascular deaths \citep{Cornia2016}. In Russian Federation, specifically, the fastest relative upswing in 
mortality was recorded for the 20–39 age group, while the fastest absolute rise occurred among 40–59 year olds. The fact that almost four fifths 
of the Russian rise in age-standardized death rates between 1980 and 2006 is due to increases in injury and cardiovascular disease mortality 
underscores the urgency of identifying the upstream factors \citep{Eberstadt1999}.

However, the "causes of causes" are causing double voice. The literature is fundamentally divided on the extent to which mass privatization 
was the decisive upstream factor driving these outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Argument for Correlation (Privatization as a Crucial Factor): A large body of cross-national and quasi-experimental 
    research supports the hypothesis that rapid and extensive privatization (often referred to as mass privatization) was a "crucial determinant" 
    of the adverse mortality trends \citep{Stuckler2009} \citep{King2009} \citep{Azarova2018} \citep{Azarova2019}. The primary mechanism linking 
    this policy to premature death is identified as acute psychosocial stress caused by rapid economic dislocation. For example, one quasi-experimental 
    retrospective cohort study in post-Soviet Russian Federation found that fast-privatized towns experienced 13\% higher mortality among working-age 
    men than slow-privatized towns \citep{Azarova2018}. These findings provided compelling evidence that rapid privatization contributed to raised 
    working-age male mortality. In case of female related research, the one was made among women in Hungary \citep{Scheiring2018}. Results indicated that
    prolonged state ownership was associated with protection of life chances during the post-socialist transformation for women.
    Another research reexamined the argument that alcohol policies were the key behind the mortality crisis in 
    Russian Federation, and they found it as non robust. At the same time, they confirmed the robust link between rapid privatization and increased 
    mortality \citep{Azarova2019}. This link is further supported by evidence that privatization, and the associated increase in unemployment, 
    was strongly associated with mortality in former Soviet Union countries \citep{Stuckler2009}.

    \item Argument Against Robust Correlation (Methodological Skepticism): Conversely, other prominent studies challenge the conclusion that mass privatization 
    was the primary cause of the crisis, citing methodological weaknesses and a lack of empirical robustness \citep{Earle2010} \citep{Gerry2010} \citep{Earle2013} 
    \citep{Bhattacharya2013}. Critics argue that the claim that mass privatization adversely affected male mortality trends "does not stand up to 
    closer examination" and is contradicted by other knowledge about health trends in the region. Some analyses found that the correlation between 
    rapid privatization and mortality fails to hold across countries. Specifically, a study focusing on Russian Federationn regions found no robust 
    evidence supporting the hypotheses that the mortality spike was caused primarily by the rebound effect (from the Gorbachev anti-alcohol campaign) 
    or the affordability of alcohol. Instead, they concluded that the privatization-mortality link is robust to controlling for alcohol policy 
    \citep{Treisman2010}. Other reviews, however, found that while four out of five studies showed rapid privatization to be significantly and 
    positively related to mortality \citep{Scheiring2019}, with the only exception of Christopher J. Gerry \citep{Gerry2012}. Gerry critiques the Stuckler 
    et al. article for committing an ecological fallacy. He argues that their broad, country-level analysis fails to prove that mass privatization was 
    directly responsible for causing death at the individual level.
\end{itemize}

The overall scientific knowledge on the effects of politico-economic transitions on health outcomes remains "inconclusive" and there definitely
is an area to make further examination, which the rest of the paper will be devoted to.



% partly because macro-level results may suffer from ecological fallacy, and high-quality individual-level 
% data remain "scarce". The failure to establish a definitive result regarding the mortality effect of specific macro-policy variables suggests 
% that other mediating institutional factors—such as the strength of the political system—are necessary to explain the disparate outcomes.


% Out of the five cross-country studies we found and included in our review four demonstrated that rapid privatisation is significantly and positively 
% associated with mortality with the only exception of Gerry (2012). Gerry argues that the cross-national nature of the article by 
% Stuckler et al. results in ecological fallacy, that is, fail to establish an individual level linkage between mass privatisation and mortality. 
% The debate attracted a lot of attention in media (see e.g. Earle and Gehlbach 2010, Gerry et al. 2010a,b, King et al. 2006, Sachs 2009a,b). 
% The critics emphasise the risks of ecological fallacy and confounding by other factors that over time correlated with mass privatisation,
% suggesting that the alternative analyses could yield different results. This is indeed a limitation of cross-country approaches. 
% However, using multilevel data on settlements and individuals we have confirmed that privatisation was associated with higher mortality among men in
% Russia (Azarova et al. 2017), and among women in Hungary (Scheiring et al., 2018b).

% This literature review confirms two major findings: (1) Economic shock, particularly rapid privatization, correlates with high mortality, 
% notably in FSU states, through mechanisms linked to social dislocation and psychosocial stress; and (2) Behavioral factors, specifically 
% tobacco consumption, were the largest single drivers of premature mortality differences between CEE and Western Europe.
% However, the literature has not yet provided a complete answer to the central question of this thesis: explaining the 
% "Unequal Toll"—the wide cross-country variation in health outcomes across CEE and FSU.

% 2.3.2. Causal Debate: Privatization, Stress, and Institutions
% The core debate centers on the "causes of causes" of this crisis:
% 1. Macro-Policy (Privatization/Dislocation): Key literature argues that rapid and extensive privatization (mass privatization) was a 
% "crucial economic policy factor" driving the decline in life expectancy. This policy is hypothesized to have created excess psychosocial stress 
% by rapidly dismantling the established social order, leading to unemployment and business failures. A micro-level study in Russian Federationn towns 
% confirmed that fast privatization increased male mortality by 15–17%.
% 2. Alcohol/Lifestyle: Alternative hypotheses suggested the crisis resulted from adverse lifestyles, the increased relative affordability of vodka, 
% or a "rebound" of delayed deaths following Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign. However, recent research suggests that the rebound and affordability 
% effects did not play a major role in the European part of Russian Federation, supporting the role of psychosocial stress generated by socio-economic dislocation.
% 3. Institutional Mediation: The relative success of Central European countries is attributed to their smaller initial economic and social distortions, 
% shorter recessions, and "the active role played by intermediate social bodies" (such as trade unions) in managing social dislocations. Furthermore, 
% the institutional changes in the Czech Republic and Poland included the reorientation of health policies and the development of modern health policies.

It is clearly visible that countries like Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus experienced significant drops in especially male 
life expectancy during the early 1990s. Countries like Czech Republic and Poland on the other hand managed to avoid such 
dramatic declines and even experienced some increases in life expectancy, especially after 1991. In case of all postcommunist countries, 
the trends were much more negative for men than for women. In comparison, Western European countries like Austria, Sweden and France
experienced similar increases in life expectancy for both men and women, and those levels were generally higher than in postcommunist 
countries for 1989-1991 period and then the gap started to close in case of Central Europe in the following years.
